# GUI-For-Sign-language-recognition
Implementaion of GUI for Sign language to text to audio using Python's tkinter and some other modules.

I just inserted sample text in place of output text. Didn't implement any neural network to guess the sign from input image.

Having zero knowledge, it took around 10 hrs to implement and get all the components together. So I'm posting this script so that it could be helpful to someone who is searching like I did.

The script contains code to take input from webcam, applying filter on it, displaying both simultaneously on window. Also it contains code to convert text to mp3 and play it (works only when the system is connected to internet).
